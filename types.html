               Soldiers would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther.
               The water dilutes the espresso while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.</p></td>

          <p class="element3">This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United States as well.
             It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam layer and additional flavorings that can be added to it.</p></td>
